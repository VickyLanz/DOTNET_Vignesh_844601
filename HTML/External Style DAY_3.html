	<p>The Tamil Nadu Forest Department has completed a journey
	of more than 160 years. Since the formation of the Department
	in 1856, during the last sixteen decades Forest Department had 
	witnessed many transformations. The initiatives of the Department
	in the erstwhile Madras Presidency and in the Tamil Nadu State
	after independence where largely guided by the National Forest 
	Policies of 1894, 1952 and 1988 and programmes supported mainly
	through fund allocations in the Five Year Plans.
