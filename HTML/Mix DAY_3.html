<p class="p2">The Tamil Nadu Forest Department has completed
 a journey of more than 160 years. Since the formation 
 of the Department in 1856, during the last sixteen
 decades Forest Department had witnessed many transformations.
 The initiatives of the Department in the erstwhile Madras
 Presidency and in the Tamil Nadu State after independence where
 largely guided by the National Forest Policies of 1894, 1952
 and 1988 and programmes supported mainly through fund allocations
 in the Five Year Plans.
